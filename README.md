# Competitive Rounds
--------------------

This mod adds several options to the game aimed at competitive play.

### Pick Phase Timer
--------------------

A countdown timer during the pick phase. When it runs out, the player is forced to pick a random card of the five presented.

### Maximum Card Count

A cap on the number of cards a player can have. When a player reaches this cap, they will be forced to discard a card from their deck each pick phase before drawing another.
